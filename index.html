        Create mech DONE For creative mechanical design and engineering we had
        to create a Rube Goldberg machine, 3D model, and perform stress
        analysis. The course had me work mostly on technology and realization,
        as we had to use calculations and models to show the feasibility of our
        designs, the course itself gave me a few ways to check if the design was
        good, or if it would break under stress. Going into this course I
        thought it would be a lot of fun, as I personally like to 3D model,
        however it went wrong right from the get-go, I was not able to step up
        to people from whom I knew were good teammates and thus I was left with
        a team in which the team work was sub-par to say the least, I had to do
        most of the work (60% for a group of 4) and had to stay awake in the
        evenings as the others needed my help to do their parts as well, we
        failed this course the first time, after which it took me multiple weeks
        to get everyone back together for the retake, for the retake I took the
        lead, which made it so I had to do even more work, I also was not able
        to voice my opinions to the group, though I did ask for a peer review,
        which in the end did not do anything to how the teamwork went. I am not
        quite sure what I should do in case something like this happens again, I
        did try to voice my opinion, but teammates just accused each other
        instead of also looking at themselves as well, I also went to the person
        giving the course, but they did not take it that seriously. The only
        thing I think I could have done is make sure that I would have gotten a
        good team at the start, but that will not help me if I get into such a
        situation again. One thing that I will do is ask for a meeting next
        time, as my mails were just not taken seriously.
